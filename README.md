# Steam Game Recommendation System

A hybrid machine learning system for personalized game recommendation on the Steam platform,
combining collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and sentiment-aware quality modeling.

## Overview
With the rapid growth of games on Steam, users often face difficulties discovering titles
that truly match their preferences. Traditional recommendation approaches based on popularity
or simple tags fail to capture semantic content and user sentiment.

This project proposes a hybrid recommendation framework that integrates:
- user behavior (playtime),
- semantic game content,
- community review sentiment,
to generate accurate and personalized game recommendations.

## System Architecture

## Methodology
The system consists of three complementary modules:

- **Sentiment-Aware Quality Model**
  - Uses VADER to analyze user review sentiment
  - Combines sentiment score with overall rating to estimate game quality

- **Content-Based Filtering**
  - Sentence-BERT (SBERT) for semantic embedding of game descriptions
  - TruncatedSVD and K-Means for dimensionality reduction and clustering
  - Cosine similarity for content-based recommendation

- **Collaborative Filtering**
  - Implicit feedback modeling using user playtime
  - Matrix factorization via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

The final recommendation score is generated through a weighted fusion strategy
that balances relevance, diversity, and quality.

## Features
- **Content-based filtering** – Recommends games similar to those a user has played
- **Collaborative filtering (SVD)** – Uses matrix factorization to find user-item patterns
- **Rating-based scoring** – Incorporates game popularity and comprehensive scores
- **Hybrid combination** – Intelligently merges multiple recommendation approaches with adjustable weights
- **Batch processing** – Supports recommendations for multiple users at once
- **Interactive CLI** – User-friendly command-line interface

## How It Works
1. Loads precomputed game similarities, SVD model, and game ratings
2. Generates recommendations from each component
3. Combines scores using configurable weights
4. Filters out games already played by the user
5. Ranks and returns top recommendations

## environment
Requirements
Python 3.7+

pandas, numpy

(Due to different code paths, it is only for display and archiving)
Includes:
crawler/:
game_info_crawler.py: crawling game information including game description, games tag, genres
game_review_crawler.py: crawling for user rating and review for all the games

Code corresponding to the three recommendation models

## Usage
Run the system interactively:
```bash
python hybrid_recommender_improved.py
input the user_id in "example user_id for test.txt" or column "user_id" in "recommendations_small.csv"

the result will save as .csv file

e.g. successful running sample in running_sample1.png and running_sample2.png
